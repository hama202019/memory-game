<h1>Memory Game</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>

This is a simple memory game created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of the game is to match all pairs of cards in the shortest amount of time possible. The game includes a timer to keep track of the player's time, and a move counter to keep track of the number of moves the player makes.

<h3>Installation</h3>

To play the game, simply open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

<h3>Usage</h3>

When the game is loaded, click on any card to reveal its hidden symbol. Then, click on a second card to try and find a match. If the symbols match, the cards will stay flipped over. If the symbols do not match, the cards will flip back over and you will have to try again. Keep playing until you have matched all the cards.
